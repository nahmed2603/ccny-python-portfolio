Course Project Overview

This repository contains coding projects and activities developed as part of CSC 10800: Intro to Data Science at City College. The goal of these projects is to apply fundamental programming skills in Python to solve problems and create engaging coding experiences. These activities serve as practical exercises to build confidence in using Python for data science and other applications.

Purpose

The projects in this repository are designed to:

Practice Python programming basics, such as variables, data types, loops, and conditionals.
Explore the application of coding concepts in interactive projects and activities.
Develop a foundation for further work in data science, including data analysis and visualization.
Educational Use

This repository is part of my social coding portfolio and is open for educational purposes. Students and learners are encouraged to explore the code, build upon it, and adapt it for their own learning experiences. The contents are intended to foster collaboration and support the learning community in understanding Python and its applications.
