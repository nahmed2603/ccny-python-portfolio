Creating The Queers allowed me to explore a playful yet reflective journey of navigating queer spaces in New York City.
The game follows my partner and me as we try to make our way to Henrietta’s, a vibrant queer venue, facing the familiar challenges of city transportation. 
Each choice—from waiting for a crowded subway to calling a rideshare—mirrors the unpredictability of getting to such spaces, where every journey is filled with unexpected delays, detours, and moments of joy. 
The game not only reflects the importance of queer spaces as destinations for connection and fun but also underscores the journey itself—the decision-making, the small victories, and even the frustrations that come with getting there. It became a fun metaphor for navigating the complexities of life while cherishing the moments spent in spaces where we feel seen, celebrated, and free.
